                    <p>Shaniyat Chowdhury is a working-class public school educator and marine corps veteran running for office to represent the communities of New York State Assembly 24th District, including the neighborhoods of Jamaica, Jamaica Estates, Holliswood, Hollis Hills, Glen Oaks, Oakland Gardens, Briarwood, and Richmond Hill.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Shaniyat began his public service career and advocacy at the age of 18, having served our country in the United States Marine Corps from 2011-2017. His commitment to serving his communities continued when he returned home and worked for the New York State Assembly on policy that improved the needs of everyday New Yorkers. Shaniyat continued his advocacy by co-founding Bangladeshi Americans for Political Progress(BAPP), a grassroots organization which empowers Bangladeshi Americans to exercise their vote. After running for United States Congress in 2020, Shaniyat took his experience into the classroom as a substitute teacher for New York City Public High Schools amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, teaching students US Government and the importance of being engaged in their communities.

                <h2>
                    <br/>Why I am running?</h2>
                <p>
                    <br/>
                    I am running for State Assembly because Queens raised me to be the person I am today, and our community deserves leadership that will finally put us first. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I’ve seen the struggle of my parents who fought to overcome adversity, as working-class immigrants. My father drives for Uber as a living and my mother cleaned hotel rooms growing up. We experienced housing insecurity time and time again after the 2007 housing crisis and like many families, we were forced to deal with unregulated rent increases by greedy landlords. Like many cab drivers, my father lost his taxi medallion in 2015 without any debt relief. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Through their perseverance, my parents taught me to ‘always give back’ to those who raised me. As a lifelong public servant, I understood that not only did I have to give back to my parents, but also we must open our hearts to every New Yorker who endured significant challenges. We always envision the best for our children. It is now our opportunity to give back with bold and experienced leadership. After decades of serving as our representative, the incumbent looked past our district to run for other public office while our communities were neglected. It's time we finally have an Assemblymember who will put our communities first. I am ready to serve on day one with a plan to address public safety, economic inequalities, and health inequities. We will do it together with a coalition of everyday Queens residents working together for a brighter future. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    It’s time to put our community first. Vote for Shaniyat Chowdhury, Democrat for New York State Assembly.

                    <h2>Climate Change</h2>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        As a first responder during Superstorm Sandy, I firmly believe climate change is real. I organized around climate sustainability as a student at Queensborough Community College shortly afterwards because I understood we have a responsibility to act. The remnants of Hurricane Ida make this more urgent to address.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We will oppose the implementation of pipelines and fossil fuel infrastructures.</li>
                        <li>We will support community owned solar energy projects and promote food sustainability to grow community gardens in food deserts.</li>
                        <li>Environmental racism is one of the leading causes of health inequities, including respiratory and mental health for black, brown, and immigrant families. This is why we need a Green New Deal for NYCHA. It will create unionized jobs and eliminate carbon, lead, and mold from building infrastructures.</li>
                        <li>New York State will be authorized to create an agency which will buy out power companies such as Con Edison and National Grid and bring it under community ownership. As a result, this will lower energy prices and ensure every family can be provided energy in every home.</li>
                        <li>New York State will expand the right of tenants to make it easier to rent out regulated basement apartments. There are tens of thousands of such units, the only places where many low-income New Yorkers and immigrants can afford to live, even if cramped, unregulated conditions put them at risk of floods, fires and many other threats. We must protect every New Yorker so they have a safe home.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        As a teacher in the New York City Department of Education, I’ve seen what does and does not work for our children. Young students are placed into environments where they are expected to succeed early without the necessary tools to support them. This already creates a disadvantage for black, brown, and immigrant students who are disportionately targeted from having access to equitable education. We are almost 70 years removed from the landmark decision of Brown v. The Board of Education, and though New York is considered the most diverse state, it is also the most segregated state in the country. Here is what we can do to create a fair educational system for all of us.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Academic achievements should be prioritized for admissions into specialized high schools by repealing the Hecht-Calandra Act.</li>
                        <li>We need to end the school-to-prison pipeline especially for students with disabilities. With the presence of more guidance counselors, mental health experts, and social workers in our buildings, we can ensure every student can succeed in a safe and healthy learning environment.</li>
                        <li>We must demand and invest $4 billion owed to our public schools by ending subsidies given to charter schools.</li>
                        <li>We can ensure students have access to free kosher and halal school meals throughout New York State. No student should be coming to and leaving school on an empty stomach because of their religious faith.</li>
                        <li>CUNY and SUNY need to be fully funded, and adjunct professors should be provided a living wage. As a graduate of CUNY, I am a firm believer that every student should have access to higher education regardless of socioeconomic status. Adjunct professors are the backbone of these institutions. Higher Education needs both students and professors to create a New York that is livable for all of us.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    <h2>Housing</h2>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        Growing up, my family endured the challenges of housing insecurity like so many other immigrant and low-income families had to face. It is impossible to call a country we love our home without a home. New York has one of the largest economies in the world. There is no reason why anyone should be homeless. This is why I believe <strong>housing is a human right</strong> for all of us.
                    </p>                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>We need to create a fair relationship between landlords and tenants. No one should be evicted without good-cause. We must also enact universal-statewide rent control and the right to lease renewal to extend tenant protections.</li>
                        <li>NYCHA must be prioritized and public housing needs to be kept public. The ultra-wealthy need to pay their fair share in taxes, so we can streamline revenue to repair NYCHA and build truly affordable housing. I will also work with NYS to create a rental assistance program for our undocumented immigrants who are homeless or at risk of being homeless. </li>
                        <li>It is difficult for tenants to purchase homes in an unstable housing market. Tenant rights can be extended for those seeking permanent housing by creating a pathway for home ownership when the rented home is up for sale by the landlord.</li>
                        <li>The Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (S3157/A5971) gives collective tenants the right to organize and purchase buildings landlords decide to put up for sale for the purposes of community land trust, low-income cooperatives, and more social housing.</li>
                        <li>Luxury developers need to be stopped from commodifying our communities. We must end tax abatements such as 485-a and 421-a for luxury developers. These loopholes cost New Yorkers billions of dollars annually. By closing these loopholes, we can invest repairs into existing public housing and create revenue for more social housing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    <h2>Immigration</h2>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        I am inspired by immigrant activists every day. My father took me to my first rally when I was 13 years of age, to help fight and protect the jobs of many immigrant families during the financial crisis of 2007. In 2018, I travelled to the US and Mexico border to help families seek asylum. This is the community that motivates me to fight for them in New York State. As a first-generation born, I believe as children and now adults, we have an obligation to protect all of our families who raised us.
                    </p>                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Every New York resident has the right to vote and hold public office regardless of immigrant status.</li>
                        <li>By supporting the New York Health Act (S5475/A6058), every low-income New Yorker will have free healthcare, including our immigrant communities.</li>
                        <li>ICE should be banned from all New York courthouses and hospitals, and persons' information must be protected and disclosed from ICE agents.</li>
                        <li>Immigrant rights should be expanded so they can organize unions from exploitative industries and recover stolen wages.</li>
                        <li>We must fully fund all social and legal services for all low-income families, including immigrants.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    <h2>Public Transit</h2>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        New York cannot function without public transit. More than 10 million people ride the subways and buses daily to commute to work, school, and to visit friends and family. New York has a deteriorating infrastructure that is creating more congestion on our roads resulting in affecting climate change. For many families, driving is their one option for mode of transportation. This is because the access to equitable public transportation has not been presented. New York can do more to protect working class transit riders.
                    </p>                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Not only is gas expensive, but drilling for oil is destroying our planet. We only have one! For travelling families, we can limit the amount of gas operated vehicles on the roads by creating a pilot program for e-car stations in public transportation deserts.</li>
                        <li>We can demand the US Congress to fund public transportation to create and expand subway lines in working class and low income communities, and make it more accessible for people with disabilities. </li>
                        <li>Federal revenue can be streamlined  to improve our roads, reduce traffic, improve and protect bus and biking transients.</li>
                        <li>We will tax Wall Street to reduce and eliminate subway and bus fares. We will also use tax revenue to ensure transit workers will always have safe working conditions. </li>
                        <li>Investment in non-incarceral alternatives for public safety should be prioritized.</li>
                    </ul>
